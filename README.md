# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play the game by taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game results in a tie.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on the cells to place their marks (X or O).
- **Winning Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won or if it ends in a tie.
- **Restart Option**: A "Restart Game" button allows players to start a new game at any time.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The first player (X) clicks on an empty cell to place their mark.
3. The second player (O) then clicks on another empty cell to place their mark.
4. The game continues until a player gets three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or the game ends in a tie.
5. A message will appear announcing the winner or if itâ€™s a tie.
6. To play again, click the "Restart Game" button.

## Customization

- You can change the appearance of the game by modifying the CSS in the `index.html` file.
- The game logic can be adjusted by editing the JavaScript within the same file.
